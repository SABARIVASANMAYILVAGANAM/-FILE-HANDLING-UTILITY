*DESCRIPTION :*
File handling is an essential concept in Java that enables programs to create, read, write, and modify files stored on a system. In this task, a Java program is developed to demonstrate file operations using FileWriter and BufferedReader. The program begins by writing predefined content to a text file named example.txt, ensuring that the file is created if it does not already exist. It then reads the content from the file and displays it on the console. To modify the file, the program appends new text using FileWriter in append mode, allowing updates without overwriting the existing content. After modification, the program reads the file again to display the updated content. The structured execution of this program ensures a clear demonstration of file handling concepts. File operations are widely used in various real-world applications, such as logging systems, data storage, and configuration management. By implementing this program, users gain hands-on experience in efficiently managing files, which is a crucial skill in Java programming. The successful execution of this program results in a smooth workflow where data is dynamically stored, retrieved, and updated. The expected output clearly showcases the sequence of operations, making it easier to understand file handling in Java. This project strengthens fundamental programming skills and prepares users for more advanced applications involving file processing and data management.
